## U.S. Dam

Worldwide, many countries have built dams on their rivers. Among 140 countries, about 800,000 small dams and 50,000 large dams were built.  There are about 84,000 dams in the United States. 
The International Commission on Large Dams states that a large dam either is at least 15 meters tall from its lowest foundation to its crest, or that it stores more than 3 million cubic meters of water with a height between 5 and 15 meters. This is a story map that shows information about dams in the United States. Spatial data comes from the GRanD(The Global Reservoir and Dam Database), which has information about existing dams and reservoirs all over the world. This website contains information about dams in the U.S., explains environmental impacts of dams, and presents four dams in the U.S.
* Hoover dam: created the biggest reservoir in the U.S.
*	Oroville dam: the tallest dam in the U.S. In 2017, the water level was so high that about 200,000 residents in the nearby area needed to be evacuated.
* Bonneville dam: A project relate to Great Depression at the 1930's
